                            p Available after you've played 25 matches, ranked play is designed for players that want to put their skills to the test. To get started, log in to Ranked Royale, verify your Epic Games account, and then wait for the countdown. When the countdown finishes, click "Play" in Fortnite and enter your server ID once the game loads.
                            p Every player must first complete 10 placement matches to obtain their initial Elo rating. This rating will be a number between 1 and 3000, with higher values indicating a greater skill level. Players will also be assigned a tier based on their rating - Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Epic.
                            p As you compete, your rating will increase or decrease with each win or loss based on a number of factors including your placement, number of kills, and the skill of the other players in the match.

                            p We track the stats for all Ranked Royale players in a match. Once a match ends, each player's kills and placement are compared and used to adjust Elo ratings. There are no arbitrary number of kills for points; every kills counts alongside your overall placement.

                            p Scrims are when multiple players queue at the same time to play against each other in the same match. They work the same way our ranked matches do, but stats and skill rating are not tracked. They are generally more competitive than normal games.

                            p Unless Ranked Royale is offline, it should accept your friend request. Make sure to double check your entire friends list and try restarting your game and/or the Epic Games Launcher. If after a few minutes you still don't see the friend, please remove and readd Ranked Royale to restart the verification process.

                            h3 Ranked Royale accepted my friend request, but I do not see a code.
                            p You should receive a code in a chat message within Fortnite or the Epic Games Launcher. This is found in the bottom left corner of the Fortnite lobby and a separate window in the Epic Games Launcher. If after a few minutes you don't see a code, please remove and readd Ranked Royale as a friend to restart the verification process.

                            h3 My match stats did not get tracked.
                            p Match stats are updated once a match has ended (i.e. someone wins). If your stats still do not appear, there are a number of reasons a match could go untracked. Matches must have 5 Ranked Royale players to count toward your stats and Elo rating. If Epic's stats report more than one match for you when a match ends, we do not record the match. It could also just be a bug on our end. If you're having trouble, please contact us.

                            h3 I don't see my platform?
                            p Right now we support PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. When Epic adds support for Switch and mobile stat tracking, we'll add them!
